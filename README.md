### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Projec title: An Exploration of Specific Happiness
+ This project is conducted by Danielle Solomon

+ Project summary: The HappyDB provides us with 100,000 responses to the question of "what made you happy today?". This project takes a step in the direction of delving into the general categories that this dataset is broken into. Humans are so diverse yet, we all share the ability to be happy. I wanted to see what these categories of happiness were made from and I used some of my own sources of happiness as a frame of reference! Limitations to this method of exploration are also considered.
